For everyone to have the opportunity to be involved in a given group and to
participate in its activities the structure must be explicit, not implicit.
The rules of decision-making must be open and available to everyone, and
this can happen only if they are formalized. This is not to say that
formalization of a structure of a group will destroy the informal
structure. It usually doesn't. But it does hinder the informal structure
from having predominant control and make available some means of attacking
it if the people involved are not at least responsible to the needs of the
group at large. "Structurelessness" is organizationally impossible. We
cannot decide whether to have a structured or structureless group, only
whether or not to have a formally structured one.
