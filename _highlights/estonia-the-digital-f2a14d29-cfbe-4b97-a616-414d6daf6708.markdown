Today, citizens can vote from their laptops and challenge parking tickets
from home. They do so through the “once only” policy, which dictates that
no single piece of information should be entered twice. Instead of having
to “prepare” a loan application, applicants have their data—income, debt,
savings—pulled from elsewhere in the system. There’s nothing to fill out in
doctors’ waiting rooms, because physicians can access their patients’
medical histories. Estonia’s system is keyed to a chip-I.D. card that
reduces typically onerous, integrative processes—such as doing taxes—to
quick work.
