Rotation of tasks among individuals. Responsibilities which are held too
long by one person, formally or informally, come to be seen as that
person's "property" and are not easily relinquished or controlled by the
group. Conversely, if tasks are rotated too frequently the individual does
not have time to learn her job well and acquire the sense of satisfaction
of doing a good job.
