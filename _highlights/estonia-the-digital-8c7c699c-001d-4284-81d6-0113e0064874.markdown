Finding the business interests of the rich and powerful—a hefty field of
journalism in the United States—takes a moment’s research, because every
business connection or investment captured in any record in Estonia becomes
searchable public information. (An online tool even lets citizens map webs
of connection, follow-the-money style.) Traffic stops are illegal in the
absence of a moving violation, because officers acquire records from a
license-plate scan. Polling-place intimidation is a non-issue if people can
vote—and then change their votes, up to the deadline—at home, online. And
heat is taken off immigration because, in a borderless society, a resident
need not even have visited Estonia in order to work and pay taxes under its
dominion.
