Those on the right choose to highlight the powerful role played by personal relationships, volunteering, freedom and control, and even organised religion (people who go to church are happier, though it’s the attendance rather than the religious belief that makes the difference). 43 In contrast, those on the left may choose to highlight the higher well-being returns to boosting income at lower income levels, the negative impacts of unemployment, and the role the state can play in reducing risk.
