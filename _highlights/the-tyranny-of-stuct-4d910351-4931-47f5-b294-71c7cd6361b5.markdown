Diffusion of information to everyone as frequently as possible. Information
is power. Access to information enhances one's power. When an informal
network spreads new ideas and information among themselves outside the
group, they are already engaged in the process of forming an opinion --
without the group participating. The more one knows about how things work
and what is happening, the more politically effective one can be.
