Yeah, it isn’t that we shouldn’t be proud of what we do, but I think there’s some value in realizing that most of the world doesn’t give two shits about what we do during the day. That’s not to say that I don’t feel like my work is significant, but it reminds me not to take things too seriously and also not to worry about what anyone else thinks.
