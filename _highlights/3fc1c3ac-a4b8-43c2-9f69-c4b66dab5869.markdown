Which left us with a chronological problem: While the emotional throughline of the film was working, the age difference between Muntz and Carl (who&#x2019;d admired him since childhood) should have meant that Muntz was pushing a hundred. But we were late in the game&#x2014;too late to fix it&#x2014;and in the end, we simply decided not to address it. We&#x2019;ve found over the years that if people are enjoying the world you&#x2019;ve created, they will forgive little inconsistencies, if they notice them at all. In this case, nobody noticed&#x2014;or if they did, they didn&#x2019;t care.
