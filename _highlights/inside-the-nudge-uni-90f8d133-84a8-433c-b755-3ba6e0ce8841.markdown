Keynes’s ‘animal spirits’. Even if your business seems all right, with money in the bank and enough orders coming in, if you sense that other businesses around you are in trouble and there is no help at hand, then you will hold back. You won’t take on that extra employee, or invest in new equipment, if you think other businesses are in trouble.
