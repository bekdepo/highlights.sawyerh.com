But if every day is sunny and it doesn&#x2019;t rain, things don&#x2019;t grow. And if it&#x2019;s sunny all the time&#x2014;if, in fact, we don&#x2019;t ever even have night&#x2014;all kinds of things don&#x2019;t happen and the planet dries up. The key is to view conflict as essential, because that&#x2019;s how we know the best ideas will be tested and survive. You know, it can&#x2019;t only be sunlight.
