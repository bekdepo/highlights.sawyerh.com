when we use that more horizontal back angle, the bar must be placed on the back such that the bar is over the middle of the foot. The lower the bar is on the back, the more horizontal the back angle can be. The bar should therefore be in the lowest secure position it can occupy on the back, right below the spine of the scapula – that bump on your shoulder blade you can feel when you reach across and touch the back of your shoulder. Any lower than this, and the bar scoots down a little every rep of the set.
