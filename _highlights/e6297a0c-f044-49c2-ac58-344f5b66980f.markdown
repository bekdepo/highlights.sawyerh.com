&#x201C;Sometimes in meetings, I sense people seizing up, not wanting to even talk about changes,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;So I try to trick them. I&#x2019;ll say, &#x2018;This would be a big change if we were really going to do it, but just as a thought exercise, what if &#x2026;&#x2019; Or, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m not actually suggesting this, but go with me for a minute &#x2026;&#x2019; If people anticipate the production pressures, they&#x2019;ll close the door to new ideas&#x2014;so you have to pretend you&#x2019;re not actually going to do anything, we&#x2019;re just talking, just playing around. Then if you hit upon some new idea that clearly works, people are excited about it and are happier to act on the change.&#x201D;
