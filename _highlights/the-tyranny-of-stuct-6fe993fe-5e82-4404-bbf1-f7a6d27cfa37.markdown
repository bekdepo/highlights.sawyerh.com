structurelessness becomes a way of masking power, and within the women's
movement is usually most strongly advocated by those who are the most
powerful (whether they are conscious of their power or not). As long as the
structure of the group is informal, the rules of how decisions are made are
known only to a few and awareness of power is limited to those who know the
rules. Those who do not know the rules and are not chosen for initiation
must remain in confusion, or suffer from paranoid delusions that something
is happening of which they are not quite aware.
