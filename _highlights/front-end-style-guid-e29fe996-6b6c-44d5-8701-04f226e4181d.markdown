Assess your style guide frequently, such as at the end of every sprint, testing in multiple browsers and devices as you build. Using tools like Ghostlab, Browsersync, and BrowserStack, you can check your style guide on multiple browsers and devices simultaneously. Run this testing throughout the build, otherwise it will become a source of stress right before a deadline. When you’re rapidly iterating, inconsistencies can creep in. Having all your modules in one place during code review helps keep track of what’s new, what’s a duplicate, and what’s not being used.
