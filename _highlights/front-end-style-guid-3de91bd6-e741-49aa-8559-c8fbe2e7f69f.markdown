Since performance in this project was critical, Dan and Tim thought about performance from the beginning and let it influence their design decisions. Tim even created a Grunt task to measure how fast each pattern was loading. Lonely Planet also think a lot about performance. Each JS and CSS file has performance statistics logged in the style guide, and changes to these statistics are highlighted and plotted on a graph.
