I thought a computer would eliminate all that randomness, loss and disorder. But from the first day it was disaster. In those days, whenever those days were, even just to turn the computer off, the lower part of the screen had this question in its fuzzy way-SAVE: YES/OR NO? Who thinks about SAVE: YES/OR NO? You're just turning the thing off. Who would assume No? The computer assumed No. Here you are working on something for days and days and days and then it's gone. Awful.
