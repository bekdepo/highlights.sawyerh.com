the asset “test” is an asset limit. Their house and one vehicle are exempt. Beyond those two items, they can possess only $ 3,150 in assets, total. They have to liquidate everything else4 and must put the resulting cash only into the house and the one vehicle. They can’t use the money to pay household bills, credit card bills, or Marcella’s student loans. They will have to save every receipt to prove how the money was spent.
