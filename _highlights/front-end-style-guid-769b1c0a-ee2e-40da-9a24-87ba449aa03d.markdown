Only add components that are needed. MailChimp only add new patterns when there’s a sound case for doing so, because new patterns come at a high cost in terms of additional code, maintenance, and increased cognitive load on users. MailChimp know that the more they add to their style guide, the more features they have to support and the more complex the style guide (and the site) gets.
