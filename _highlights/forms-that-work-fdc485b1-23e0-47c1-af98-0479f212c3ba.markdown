your address is usually a single topic, so it’s normal for U.S. forms to ask their U.S. customers for state and ZIP code on the same page. You’d need to have some special reason to justify splitting them. Very short pages seem to be OK if they are clearly about a single topic that is different from the one before and the one after. Don’t feel that pages have to be a minimum length.
