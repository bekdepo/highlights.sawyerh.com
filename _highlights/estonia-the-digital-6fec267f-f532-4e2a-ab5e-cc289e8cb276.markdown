“If everything is digital, and location-independent, you can run a
borderless country,” Kotka said. In 2014, the government launched a digital
“residency” program, which allows logged-in foreigners to partake of some
Estonian services, such as banking, as if they were living in the country.
Other measures encourage international startups to put down virtual roots;
Estonia has the lowest business-tax rates in the European Union, and has
become known for liberal regulations around tech research. It is legal to
test Level 3 driverless cars (in which a human driver can take control) on
all Estonian roads, and the country is planning ahead for Level 5 (cars
that take off on their own). “We believe that innovation happens anyway,”
Viljar Lubi, Estonia’s deputy secretary for economic development, says. “If
we close ourselves off, the innovation happens somewhere else.”
