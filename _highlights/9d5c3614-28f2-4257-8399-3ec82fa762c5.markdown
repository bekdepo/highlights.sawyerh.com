In an unhealthy culture, each group believes that if their objectives trump the goals of the other groups, the company will be better off. In a healthy culture, all constituencies recognize the importance of balancing competing desires&#x2014;they want to be heard, but they don&#x2019;t have to win. Their interaction with one another&#x2014;the push and pull that occurs naturally when talented people are given clear goals&#x2014;yields the balance we seek. But that only happens if they understand that achieving balance is a central goal of the company.
