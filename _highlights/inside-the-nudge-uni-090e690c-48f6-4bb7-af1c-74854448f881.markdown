children who are steered towards believing that a test result is a measure of their inherent ability (‘ good result: you’re a smart kid’) show less persistence and lower subsequent performance on a difficult task than children who are steered towards believing that a test result is a measure of their effort (good result: good effort). In Dweck’s words, the latter type of feedback creates a ‘growth mindset’, or a theory of mind that personal achievements come from effort, 8 leading the child to try harder and not give up in the face of personal challenge.
