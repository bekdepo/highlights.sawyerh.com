He and Marcella struggled to make ends meet on that near-poverty income. And then much later, at the time I was writing this book, we discovered that he probably didn’t need to reduce his pay; he and Marcella were probably not subject to a Share of Cost requirement even at Dave’s pre-accident income, a revelation to which I will return. But we didn’t know that for two years.
