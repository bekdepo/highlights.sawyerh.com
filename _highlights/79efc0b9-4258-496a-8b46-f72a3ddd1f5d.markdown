I tend to flood and freeze up if I&#x2019;m feeling overwhelmed. When this happens, it&#x2019;s usually because I feel like the world is crashing down and all is lost. One trick I&#x2019;ve learned is to force myself to make a list of what&#x2019;s actually wrong. Usually, soon into making the list, I find I can group most of the issues into two or three larger all-encompassing problems. So it&#x2019;s really not all that bad. Having a finite list of problems is much better than having an illogical feeling that everything is wrong.&#x201D;
