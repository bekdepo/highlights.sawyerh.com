If the movement continues deliberately to not select who shall exercise
power, it does not thereby abolish power. All it does is abdicate the right
to demand that those who do exercise power and influence be responsible for
it. If the movement continues to keep power as diffuse as possible because
it knows it cannot demand responsibility from those who have it, it does
prevent any group or person from totally dominating. But it simultaneously
insures that the movement is as ineffective as possible. Some middle ground
between domination and ineffectiveness can and must be found.
