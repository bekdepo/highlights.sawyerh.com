When we don't define what good means for our stakeholders and users, we aren't using language to our advantage. Without a clear understanding of what is good, bad can come out of nowhere. And while you have to define what good means to create good information architecture, it's not just the architecture part that needs this kind of focus. Every decision you make should support what you've defined as good: from the words you choose to the tasks you enable, and everything in between.
