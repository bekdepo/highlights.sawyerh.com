Dan Mall proposes baking in time after the project to revisit the style guides he delivers to clients. This is brave, because it admits the system is not going to be perfect at first. Dan uses this extra time to see what’s working, what’s not working, and how the style guide can be improved, making tweaks based on this feedback.
