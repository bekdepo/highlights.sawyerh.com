Contrary to what we would like to believe, there is no such thing as a
structureless group. Any group of people of whatever nature that comes
together for any length of time for any purpose will inevitably structure
itself in some fashion. The structure may be flexible; it may vary over
time; it may evenly or unevenly distribute tasks, power and resources over
the members of the group. But it will be formed regardless of the
abilities, personalities, or intentions of the people involved. The very
fact that we are individuals, with different talents, predispositions, and
backgrounds makes this inevitable.
