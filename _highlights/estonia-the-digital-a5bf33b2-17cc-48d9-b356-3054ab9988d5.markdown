Data aren’t centrally held, thus reducing the chance of Equifax-level
breaches. Instead, the government’s data platform, X-Road, links individual
servers through end-to-end encrypted pathways, letting information live
locally. Your dentist’s practice holds its own data; so does your high
school and your bank. When a user requests a piece of information, it is
delivered like a boat crossing a canal via locks.

Although X-Road is a government platform, it has become, owing to its
ubiquity, the network that many major private firms build on, too. Finland,
Estonia’s neighbor to the north, recently began using X-Road, which means
that certain data—for instance, prescriptions that you’re able to pick up
at a local pharmacy—can be linked between the nations. It is easy to
imagine a novel internationalism taking shape in this form.
