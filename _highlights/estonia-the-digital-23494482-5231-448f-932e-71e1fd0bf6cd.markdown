She logged on with her own I.D. If she were to glance at any patient’s
data, she explained, the access would be tagged to her name, and she would
get a call inquiring why it was necessary. The system also scans for drug
interactions, so if your otolaryngologist prescribes something that clashes
with the pills your cardiologist told you to take, the computer will put up
a red flag.
