- body: 'Solitary focused work is an invaluable part of my process. The careful messaging
    of words, exploring arrangements, testing colors, going through infinite variations
    — they all demand an intense focus that is best left uninterrupted. The key skill
    is learning to identify when you need to switch from the collaborative to individual
    context. '

- body: I also agree about the key skill about switching between contexts. In a creative
    process, the switch has to be made several times.

Work alone. You’re going to be best able to design revolutionary products and features if you’re working on your own. Not on a committee. Not on a team.
