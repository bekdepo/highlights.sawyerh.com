What does elicit a visceral reaction—hard, heavy laughter—is the wall of Kanye Commandments posted on 8.5”x 11” sheets of paper on one side of the studio. They include the obvious—”No Tweeting” and “No Pictures”—and some…well, some less obvious ones, too. Not that “No Hipster Hats” and “Just Shut the Fuck Up Sometimes” aren’t rules to live by.
