A tenet of the Estonian system is that an individual owns all information
recorded about him or her. Every time a doctor (or a border guard, a police
officer, a banker, or a minister) glances at any of Piperal’s secure data
online, that look is recorded and reported. Peeping at another person’s
secure data for no reason is a criminal offense. “In Estonia, we don’t have
Big Brother; we have Little Brother,” a local told me. “You can tell him
what to do and maybe also beat him up.”
