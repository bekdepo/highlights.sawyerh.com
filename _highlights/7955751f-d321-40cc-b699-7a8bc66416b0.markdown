I don't think you should ever say anything that you're going to have to apologize for later. If the heat gets hot, just let them get mad. How did somebody make you apologize? Did they literally hit you on your body? Let them be upset. It's not the worst thing in the world. It doesn't mean you're going to be a pauper. It's a desperate thing to need everybody to be really happy with everything you say. To me the way to manage is not to have 50 versions of yourself — I do this thing, and the next time you're going to hear me is the next time I do another one.
