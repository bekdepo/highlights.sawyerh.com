Because elites are informal does not mean they are invisible. At any small
group meeting anyone with a sharp eye and an acute ear can tell who is
influencing whom. The members of a friendship group will relate more to
each other than to other people. They listen more attentively, and
interrupt less; they repeat each other's points and give in amiably; they
tend to ignore or grapple with the "outs" whose approval is not necessary
for making a decision.
