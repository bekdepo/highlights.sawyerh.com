Today, the old fatuities of the nation-state are showing signs of crisis.
Formerly imperialist powers have withered into nationalism (as in Brexit)
and separatism (Scotland, Catalonia). New powers, such as the Islamic
State, have redefined nationhood by ideological acculturation. It is
possible to imagine a future in which nationality is determined not so much
by where you live as by what you log on to.
