I asked Kaevats what he saw when he looked at the U.S. Two things, he said.
First, a technical mess. Data architecture was too centralized. Citizens
didn’t control their own data; it was sold, instead, by brokers. Basic
security was lax. “For example, I can tell you my I.D. number—I don’t
fucking care,” he said. “You have a Social Security number, which is, like,
a big secret.” He laughed. “This does not work!” The U.S. had backward
notions of protection, he said, and the result was a bigger problem: a
systemic loss of community and trust. “Snowden things and whatnot have done
a lot of damage. But they have also proved that these fears are justified.

“To regain this trust takes quite a lot of time,” he went on. “There also
needs to be a vision from the political side. It needs to be there always—a
policy, not politics. But the politicians need to live it, because, in
today’s world, everything will be public at some point.”
