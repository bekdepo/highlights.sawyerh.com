Nine years later another computer hit 1.8 teraflops. But instead of
simulating nuclear explosions, it was devoted to drawing them and other
complex graphics in all their realistic, real-time, three-dimensional
glory. It did this not for physicists, but for video game players. This
computer was the Sony PlayStation 3, which matched the ASCI Red in
performance, yet cost about five hundred dollars, took up less than a tenth
of a square meter, and drew about two hundred watts.
