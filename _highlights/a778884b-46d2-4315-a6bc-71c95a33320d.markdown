Rather than present something interesting, or challenging the status-quo, they fart out T-shirts with two logos haphazardly smashed together, and hype the shit on their respective Instagrams as if they expect to be showered in medals and knighted by the Queen. I can't say that I have any particular stake in the skateboarding industry, or own a lot of 'swaggy' sneakers, but when I see kids lining up outside of (generic 'swaggy' company) like a bunch of peasants hoping for a taste of potato, it makes me sad that they're not spending their money on something meaningful, like drugs or girlfriends.
