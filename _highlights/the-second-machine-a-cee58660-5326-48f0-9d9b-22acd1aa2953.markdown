Watson’s database, which consisted of approximately two hundred million
pages of documents taking up four terabytes of disk space, included an
entire copy of Wikipedia. For a while it also included the salty
language–filled Urban Dictionary, but this archive of user-generated
content was removed after, to the dismay of its creators, Watson started to
include curse words in its responses.
