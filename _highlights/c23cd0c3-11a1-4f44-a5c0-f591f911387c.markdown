I think it was Frank Chimero who compared creative satisfaction to hunger. If you eat a great meal, you are so satisfied. There's nothing like the pairing of a good red wine with a steak, but a couple hours later, you're hungry again. Creativity is like that and when that's your job, I think it gets even harder.
