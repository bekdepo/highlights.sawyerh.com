If the bar is placed high on the back – on top of the traps, where most people start off carrying it because it’s an easier and more obvious place for a bar – the back angle must accommodate the higher position by becoming more vertical to keep the bar over the mid-foot. If the back angle is more vertical, the knee angle must become more closed because the knees get shoved forward when the hips open up (Figure 2-8 again). In other words, the higher bar position makes the back squat more like the front squat, and we don’t want to front-squat for general strength development because it doesn’t effectively train the source of whole-body power: the posterior chain.
