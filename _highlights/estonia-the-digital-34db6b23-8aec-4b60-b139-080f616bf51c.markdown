Kaevats told me it irked him that so many Westerners saw his country as a
tech haven. He thought they were missing the point. “This enthusiasm and
optimism around technology is like a value of its own,” he complained.
“This gadgetry that I’ve been ranting about? This is not important.” He
threw up his hands, scattering ash. “It’s about the mind-set. It’s about
the culture. It’s about the human relations—what it enables us to do.”
