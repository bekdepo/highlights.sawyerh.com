    Watson’s database, which consisted of approximately two hundred million
pages of documents taking up four terabytes of disk space, included an
entire copy of Wikipedia. For a while it also included the salty
language–filled Urban Dictionary, but this archive of user-generated
content was removed after, to the dismay of its creators, Watson started to
include curse words in its responses.

    The Industrial Revolution was accompanied by soot-filled London skies and
horrific exploitation of child labor. What will be their modern
equivalents? Rapid and accelerating digitization is likely to bring
economic rather than environmental disruption, stemming from the fact that
as computers get more powerful, companies have less need for some kinds of
workers. Technological progress is going to leave behind some people,
perhaps even a lot of people, as it races ahead. As we’ll demonstrate,
there’s never been a better time to be a worker with special skills or the
right education, because these people can use technology to create and
capture value. However, there’s never been a worse time to be a worker with
only ‘ordinary’ skills and abilities to offer, because computers, robots,
and other digital technologies are acquiring these skills and abilities at
an extraordinary rate.

    Nine years later another computer hit 1.8 teraflops. But instead of
simulating nuclear explosions, it was devoted to drawing them and other
complex graphics in all their realistic, real-time, three-dimensional
glory. It did this not for physicists, but for video game players. This
computer was the Sony PlayStation 3, which matched the ASCI Red in
performance, yet cost about five hundred dollars, took up less than a tenth
of a square meter, and drew about two hundred watts.
