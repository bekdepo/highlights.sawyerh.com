    I listen to a bunch of different music all the time. But I try not to listen and then work. I try to create something right out of my mind. I try not to listen to a song [first, because] then you end up making [a song that sounds like what you were just listening to]. And then you feel less proud or accomplished because you feel like you just did somebody else's shit.

    Mitch Hedberg once said that if you spend your whole life preparing, then you're never going to do anything. Just jump in and do it. That's the best way to get better at something. Do it while you suck at it."

    Returning to Anil's description of the web we lost: We get a generation of entrepreneurs encouraged to make more narrow-minded, web-hostile products like these because it continues to make a small number of wealthy people even more wealthy, instead of letting lots of people build innovative new opportunities for themselves on top of the web itself.
