    Young musicians believe they should be able to throw a band together and be famous, and anything that's in their way is unfair and evil. What are you, in your 20s, you picked up a guitar? Give it a minute.

    I don't comment on stuff that's got nothing to do with me. I think it's better to talk through your work. So I just do jokes.

    I don't think you should ever say anything that you're going to have to apologize for later. If the heat gets hot, just let them get mad. How did somebody make you apologize? Did they literally hit you on your body? Let them be upset. It's not the worst thing in the world. It doesn't mean you're going to be a pauper. It's a desperate thing to need everybody to be really happy with everything you say. To me the way to manage is not to have 50 versions of yourself â€” I do this thing, and the next time you're going to hear me is the next time I do another one. As soon as you crack your knuckles and open up a comments page, you just canceled your subscription to being a good person.
