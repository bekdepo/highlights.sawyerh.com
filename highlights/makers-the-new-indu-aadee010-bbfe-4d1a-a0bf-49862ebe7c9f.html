  <blockquote class="highlight__content">
    <p>My grandfather could invent the automatic sprinkler system in his workshop, but he couldnâ€™t build a factory there. To get to market, he had to interest a manufacturer in licensing his invention. And that is not only hard, but requires the inventor to lose control of his or her invention. The owners of the means of production get to decide what is produced.</p>
