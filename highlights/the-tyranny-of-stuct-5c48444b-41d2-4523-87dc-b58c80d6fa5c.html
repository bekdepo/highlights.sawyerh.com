    <p>because there are no official spokespeople nor any decision-making body
that the press can query when it wants to know the movement’s position on a
subject, these women are perceived as the spokespeople. Thus, whether they
want to or not, whether the movement likes it or not, women of public note
are put in the role of spokespeople by default.
This is one main source of the ire that is often felt toward the women who
are labeled “stars.” Because they were not selected by the women in the
movement to represent the movement’s views, they are resented when the
press presumes that they speak for the movement. But as long as the
movement does not select its own spokeswomen, such women will be placed in
that role by the press and the public, regardless of their own desires.</p>
