  <blockquote class="highlight__content">
    To see things as they are includes seeing them as they will be, and that means picturing ourselves and our own position in time not as coming at the end, jutting out into empty space with nothing beyond, but as tucked in with manifestations of life both behind us and ahead of us. Tucked in, just as Darwin's or Hutton's time is for us as we look back on it now. This is how things will be.
