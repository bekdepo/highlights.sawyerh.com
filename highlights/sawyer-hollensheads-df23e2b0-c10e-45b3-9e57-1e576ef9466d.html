<p>only about a third of the world is on the internet today-a little more than two billion people. So we’re really very close to the beginning of this. If you look out, maybe five or ten years, when all five billion people who have feature phones are going to have smart phones, we’re soon going to be living in a world where the majority of people who have a smart phone-a modern computing device-will have never seen in their lives what you and I call a “computer.” So, just think about that for a moment.The very definition of what a computer is and what our relationship with it should be hasn’t been set for the majority of the world.</p>
