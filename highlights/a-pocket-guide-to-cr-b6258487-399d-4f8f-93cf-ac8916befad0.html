    <p>Symbol fonts are niche part of a web developer’s toolbox and they are constantly changing. It will be hard work keeping up. You will need to stay up to date on developments as well as continue to practice and hone your skills. Unlike so many other aspects of web development, font embedding and symbol fonts are very new. What this means is that knowing these skills will put you ahead of many of your peers. If you want to be the hero at the office, an indispensable part of the team and a leading expert on some aspect of web development, then this is your rare chance to take the reins and become a leader. It is unlikely the web will migrate away from HTML, JavaScript or CSS any time soon. To carve out expertise in these domains is difficult, but with symbol fonts there is still room to learn and improve. These opportunities don’t come often – don’t let it pass you by.</p>
