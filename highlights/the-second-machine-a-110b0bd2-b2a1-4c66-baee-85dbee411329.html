simulating nuclear explosions, it was devoted to drawing them and other
complex graphics in all their realistic, real-time, three-dimensional
glory. It did this not for physicists, but for video game players. This

performance, yet cost about five hundred dollars, took up less than a tenth
of a square meter, and drew about two hundred watts.</p>
