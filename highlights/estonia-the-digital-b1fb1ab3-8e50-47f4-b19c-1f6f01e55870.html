    <p>It struck me then how long it had been since anyone in America had spoken
of society-building of any kind. It was as if, in the nineties, Estonia and
the U.S. had approached a fork in the road to a digital future, and the
U.S. had taken one path—personalization, anonymity, information
privatization, and competitive efficiency—while Estonia had taken the
other. Two decades on, these roads have led to distinct places, not just in
digital culture but in public life as well.</p>
