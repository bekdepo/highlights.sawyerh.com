    <p>if you’re reading and you glance over at some side notes, it doesn’t feel very distracting. But if something tries to catch your attention outside the current frame, your attention diminishes. This happens quite a bit online, when you’re trying to read: as you scroll, pictures appear from the side (swooping in with an animation, even) and completely wreck your attention.</p>
