          Solitary focused work is an invaluable part of my process. The careful messaging of words, exploring arrangements, testing colors, going through infinite variations — they all demand an intense focus that is best left uninterrupted. The key skill is learning to identify when you need to switch from the collaborative to individual context.

          I also agree about the key skill about switching between contexts. In a creative process, the switch has to be made several times.
