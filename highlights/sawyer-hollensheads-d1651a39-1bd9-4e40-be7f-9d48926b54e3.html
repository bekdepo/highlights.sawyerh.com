    <p>There was a time when people were suspicious of having cellphones, not because they weren’t useful, not because they didn’t like them, but because sometimes, they just wanted to be left alone. You heard this a lot back when having a cellphone was a decision rather than an obvious requirement of competent living. “Sometimes I’d like to just be left alone, you know? I don’t want to have phone calls following me around.”</p>
