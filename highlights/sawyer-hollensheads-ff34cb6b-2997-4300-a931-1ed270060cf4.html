<p>Mormons also believe that if they baptize their dead relatives, those who lived before the establishment of the church, and therefore were never given the opportunity to hear the Mormon gospel, those ancestorsâ€™ spirits can go to heaven. This has led the Mormon Church to invest vast sums in genealogical research, as believers scour the world for ancestors they can posthumously convert. Many of the largest genealogical websites are linked to, or owned by, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, including Ancestry.com and FamilySearch.</p>
