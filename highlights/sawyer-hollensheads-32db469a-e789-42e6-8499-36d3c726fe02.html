    <p>Although technology will still keep up with population through 2014, it will be only through a supreme effort and with but partial success. Not all the worldâ€™s population will enjoy the gadgety world of the future to the full. A larger portion than today will be deprived and although they may be better off, materially, than today, they will be further behind when compared with the advanced portions of the world. They will have moved backward, relatively.</p>
