  <blockquote class="highlight__content">
    <p>The Industrial Revolution was accompanied by soot-filled London skies and
horrific exploitation of child labor. What will be their modern
equivalents? Rapid and accelerating digitization is likely to bring
economic rather than environmental disruption, stemming from the fact that
as computers get more powerful, companies have less need for some kinds of
workers. Technological progress is going to leave behind some people,
perhaps even a lot of people, as it races ahead. As we’ll demonstrate,
there’s never been a better time to be a worker with special skills or the
right education, because these people can use technology to create and
capture value. However, there’s never been a worse time to be a worker with
only ‘ordinary’ skills and abilities to offer, because computers, robots,
and other digital technologies are acquiring these skills and abilities at
an extraordinary rate.</p>
