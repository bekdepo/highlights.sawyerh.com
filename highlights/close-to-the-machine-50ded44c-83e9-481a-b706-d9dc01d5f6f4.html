<p>When the humans come back to talk changes, I can just run the program. Show them: Here. Look at this. See? This is not just talk. This runs. Whatever you might say, whatever the consequences, all you have are words and what I have is this, this thing Iâ€™ve built, this operational system. Talk all you want, but this thing here: it works.</p>
